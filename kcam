=head1 NAME

kcam - KayakCAM command line tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  kcam <OPTIONS> <YAK INPUT FILE> [<OUTPUT FILE> ...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

KayakCAM is a somewhat minimalist set of Perl tools for computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM) of kayaks. It builds on the file output of Kayak
Foundry ((C) 2002-2009 by Ross Leidy) to allow for further processing
beyond printing of stations, namely additional post-processing of the
geometry, exporting to OpenSCAD, generating 3D models for ray tracing
etc, and last not least CNC data.


=head2 INSTALLATION

kcam comes along with a couple of Perl modules in the namespace of
KayakCAM. Install these Perl modules somewhere where Perl can find
them. The kcam tool adds the current directory to the search path; in a pinch
just invoke the script in a directory that contains a subdirectory

  ./kcam
  ./KayakCAM/<MODULES>

with the modules.

=head2 USE

The kcam utility always takes a .yak file as its input. Its output
depends on output options and potentially additional, auxillary input
data.

The input .yak file is either given as positional parameter, either as
a full absolute or relative path to the .yak file>.

Examples:

  kcam ../../kayak.yak
  cat ../../kayak.yak | kcam

The type of output is controlled by additional positional parameters,
representing the desired output.  The file suffix controls the type of output. For example:

  kcam ../../kayak.yak  _test.stl

would read the .yak file from STDIN and create an output file
C<test.stl> for for a 3D renderer. If no output format is provided
then a short info about kayak defined in the yak file is printed to
STDERR.

More than one output can be given in a single invokation of the tool, eg:

  kcam ../../kayak.yak   _kayak.stl  _kayak.scad

would produce for the yak file C<kayak.yak> both a 3D model for
rendereing as C<_kayak.stl> and for display in OpenSCAD
C<_kayak.scad>.

This allows to run the tool in a continuous loop; any update to the
yak file will result in automatic updates to the specified output
files.
